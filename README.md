# Bruteforce-Demo
A demo of how **Bruteforce attacks** are made.

First run _SignUp.java_ to enter a name and password. All the information will be saved in the file named _Passwords.txt_. Next run _Login.java_ just to check whether the credentials were entered correclty or not.

***NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD, THEN SIMPLY REMOVE THE LINE CONTAINING YOUR INFORMATION FROM _Passwords.txt_***


Now, comes the main part. Run _Bruteforce.java_ and follow the instructions that appears on the console. If you find any bug in any file, then simply mail me that bug with a screenshot. Will surely fix it in a day or two. 
**HAVE FUN!**
